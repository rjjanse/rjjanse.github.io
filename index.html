                        <p> Hej! I'm Roemer (['rum…ôr]) and I am a PhD candidate at the Department of Clinical Epidemiology at the
                            Leiden University Medical Center, the Netherlands. The main focus of my thesis is prediction modelling of patient-reported outcomes
                            in kidney disease, although I also work on treatment trajectories, causal renal pharmacoepidemiology, and assessment in medical
                            education. This highlights my three main academic interests: medicine, epidemiology, and education, which I have ample opportunity to
                            pursue due to my background in medicine. Besides indulging in these interests, you are likely to find me making puzzles, playing 
                            tabletop games, videogames, in a boulder hall, taking pictures, or talking too much about either the Lord of the Rings or trains.

                                    <p> <b> Aim: </b> Half of heart failure (HF) patients have chronic kidney disease (CKD) complicating their pharmacological management. We evaluated physicians' and patients' patterns 
                                        of use of evidence-based medical therapies in HF across CKD stages.  <br>
                                        <b> Methods and results: </b> We studied HF patients with reduced (HFrEF) and mildly reduced (HFmrEF) ejection fraction enrolled in the Swedish Heart Failure Registry in 2009-2018. 
                                        We investigated the likelihood of physicians to prescribe guideline-recommended therapies to patients with CKD, and of patients to fill the prescriptions within 90 days of incident 
                                        HF (initiating therapy), to adhere (proportion of days covered ‚â•80%) and persist (continued use) on these treatments during the first year of therapy. We identified 31 668 patients 
                                        with HFrEF (median age 74 years, 46% CKD). The proportions receiving a prescription for angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers/angiotensin receptor-
                                        neprilysin inhibitors (ACEi/ARB/ARNi) were 96%, 92%, 86%, and 68%, for estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) ‚â•60, 45-59, 30-44, and &lt;30 ml/min/1.73 m2 , respectively; for 
                                        beta-blockers 94%, 93%, 92%, and 92%, for mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) 45%, 44%, 37%, 24%; and for triple therapy (combination of ACEi/ARB/ARNi + beta-blockers + 
                                        MRA) 38%, 35%, 28%, and 15%. Patients with CKD were less likely to initiate these medications, and less likely to adhere to and persist on ACEi/ARB/ARNi, MRA, and triple therapy. 
                                        Among stoppers, CKD patients were less likely to restart these medications. Results were consistent after multivariable adjustment and in patients with HFmrEF (n = 15 114).  <br>
                                        <b> Conclusions: </b> Patients with HF and CKD are less likely to be prescribed and to fill prescriptions for evidence-based therapies, showing lower adherence and persistence, 
                                        even at eGFR categories where these therapies are recommended and have shown efficacy in clinical trials.

                                    <p> <b> Background: </b> The risk-benefit ratio of continuing with renin-angiotensin system inhibitors (RASi) after an episode of acute kidney injury (AKI) is unclear. While stopping 
                                        RASi may prevent recurrent AKI or hyperkalaemia, it may deprive patients of the cardiovascular benefits of using RASi. <br>
                                        <b> Methods: </b> We analysed outcomes of long-term RASi users experiencing AKI (stage 2 or 3, or clinically coded) during hospitalization in Stockholm and Sweden during 2007-18. 
                                        We compared stopping RASi within 3 months after discharge with continuing RASi. The primary study outcome was the composite of all-cause mortality, myocardial infarction (MI) and 
                                        stroke. Recurrent AKI was our secondary outcome and we considered hyperkalaemia as a positive control outcome. Propensity score overlap weighted Cox models were used to estimate 
                                        hazard ratios (HRs), balancing 75 confounders. Weighted absolute risk differences (ARDs) were also determined. <br>
                                        <b> Results: </b> We included 10 165 individuals, of whom 4429 stopped and 5736 continued RASi, with a median follow-up of 2.3 years. The median age was 78 years; 45% were women 
                                        and median kidney function before the index episode of AKI was 55 mL/min/1.73 m2. After weighting, those who stopped had an increased risk [HR, 95% confidence interval (CI)] of 
                                        the composite of death, MI and stroke [1.13, 1.07-1.19; ARD 3.7, 95% CI 2.6-4.8] compared with those who continued, a similar risk of recurrent AKI (0.94, 0.84-1.05) and a decreased 
                                        risk of hyperkalaemia (0.79, 0.71-0.88). <br>
                                        <b> Discussion: </b> Stopping RASi use among survivors of moderate-to-severe AKI was associated with a similar risk of recurrent AKI, but higher risk of the composite of death, 
                                        MI and stroke.

                                        <b> Methods: </b>  We compared outcomes of adults who newly started SGLT2i or GLP1-RA therapy in Stockholm, Sweden, during 2013-2019. The primary outcome was major adverse cardiovascular events 
                                        (MACE), a composite of cardiovascular (CV) death, myocardial infarction and stroke. Secondary outcomes included the individual MACE components and hospitalization for heart failure. Cox regression 
                                        with propensity score overlap weighting was used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals and adjust for 57 covariates.  <br>
                                        <b> Results: </b> We included 12,375 individuals, of which 5489 initiated SGLT2i and 6886 GLP1-RA therapy, followed for median 1.6 years. Mean age was 61 years and 37.6% were women. Compared with 
                                        GLP1-RA, SGLT2i new users had similar risk of MACE risk (adjusted HR 1.04; 95% CI 0.83-1.31). The adjusted HRs (95% CI) for SGLT2i vs. GLP1-RA were 0.80 (0.59-1.09) for heart failure hospitalization,

                                        <b> Discussion: </b> In a largely primary-prevention population of people undergoing routine care, no differences were observed in MACE risk among initiators of SGLT2i and GLP1-RA. However, compared 
                                        with GLP1RA, the use of SGLT2i was associated with an increased risk of ischemic stroke that was small in absolute magnitude.

                                    <p> The correlation coefficient is a statistical measure often used in studies to show an association between variables or to look at the agreement between two methods. In this paper, we 
                                        will discuss not only the basics of the correlation coefficient, such as its assumptions and how it is interpreted, but also important limitations when using the correlation coefficient, 
                                        such as its assumption of a linear association and its sensitivity to the range of observations. We will also discuss why the coefficient is invalid when used to assess agreement of two 
                                        methods aiming to measure a certain value, and discuss better alternatives, such as the intraclass coefficient and Bland-Altman's limits of agreement. The concepts discussed in this 
                                        paper are supported with examples from literature in the field of nephrology.

                                        <b> Results: </b> A total of 3042 articles were identified, of which 142 studies were included, with 49 048 hospitalized COVID-19 patients including 5152 AKI events. The risk of bias 
                                        of included studies was generally low. The pooled incidence of AKI was 28.6% [95% confidence interval (CI) 19.8-39.5] among hospitalized COVID-19 patients from the USA and Europe (20 
                                        studies) and 5.5% (95% CI 4.1-7.4) among patients from China (62 studies), whereas the pooled incidence of KRT was 7.7% (95% CI 5.1-11.4; 18 studies) and 2.2% (95% CI 1.5-3.3; 52 
                                        studies), respectively. Among patients admitted to the intensive care unit, the incidence of KRT was 20.6% (95% CI 15.7-26.7; 38 studies). Meta-regression analyses showed that age, 
                                        male sex, cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, hypertension and chronic kidney disease were associated with the occurrence of AKI; in itself, AKI was associated with an increased 
                                        risk of mortality, with a pooled risk ratio of 4.6 (95% CI 3.3-6.5).  <br>
                                        <b> Discussion: </b> AKI and KRT are common events in hospitalized COVID-19 patients, with estimates varying across geographic locations. Additional studies are needed to better 
                                        understand the underlying mechanisms and optimal treatment of AKI in these patients.
