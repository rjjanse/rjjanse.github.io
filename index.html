                                <div> Hej! I'm Roemer (['rumər]) and I am a PhD candidate at the Department of Clinical Epidemiology at the
                                    Leiden University Medical Center, the Netherlands. The main focus of my thesis is prediction modelling of patient-reported outcomes
                                    in kidney disease, although I also work on descriptive epidemiology, renal pharmacoepidemiology, and assessment in medical
                                    education. This highlights my three main academic interests: medicine, epidemiology, and education, which I have ample opportunity to
                                    pursue due to my background in medicine. <br> <br>
                                    
                                    Besides these academic interests, two meta-science topics I am interested in are open science and the climate. As a proponent of open science, 
                                    I aim for my work to be open and transparent, allowing others to build on my work as much as possible. As a person conscious of the climate,
                                    I take into account my ecological footprint in everything I do, including work. This entails more than visiting conferences and the model of
                                    transportation to get there. It is my aim to be conscious of the tools I use while doing research and their carbon footprint. <br> <br>

                                    At the end of the day, you'll likely find me indulging in my personal interests, such as making puzzles, playing tabletop games, videogames, 
                                    in a boulder hall, taking pictures, dancing, or talking too much about either the Lord of the Rings or trains. <br>

                                    <p> Back in 2019 I first went bouldering, which was my first contact with climbing sports in general. Since then, I have been
                                        enchanted by climbing. Something about the child-like freedom of climbing up a wall combined with developing the skill and
                                        strength required to tackle more difficult problems really speaks to me.

                                Lord of the Rings, I am interested in mythology. Nonetheless, many a book may capture my attention. Some of the favourite books I read:

                                    <p> <b> Background: </b> Studies investigating the association of chronic kidney disease and cancer have focused on estimated glomerular filtration (eGFR) 
                                        rather than on albuminuria. This study aimed to examine whether albuminuria is associated with cancer incidence, and whether this association is 
                                        independent of eGFR. <br>
                                        <b> Methods: </b> We included subjects of the Stockholm Creatinine Measurements (SCREAM) project without a history of cancer, 250 768 subjects with at 
                                        least 1 urine albumin-creatinine ratio (ACR) test (primary cohort), and 433 850 subjects with at least 1 dipstick albuminuria test (secondary cohort). 
                                        Albuminuria was quantified as KDIGO albuminuria stages. The primary outcome was overall cancer incidence. Secondary outcomes were site-specific cancer 
                                        incidence rates. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression models adjusted for confounders including eGFR to calculate hazard ratios (HRs, 95% CIs). <br>
                                        <b> Results: </b> During a median follow-up of 4.3 (IQR, 2.0–8.2) years, 21 901 subjects of the ACR cohort developed de novo cancer. In multivariable analyses, 
                                        adjusting among others for eGFR, subjects with an ACR of 30-299 mg/g or ≥300 mg/g had a 23% (HR, 1.23; 95% CI, 1.19–1.28) and 40% (HR, 1.40; 95% CI, 1.31–1.50) 
                                        higher risk of developing cancer, respectively, when compared to subjects with an ACR &#60;30 mg/g. This graded, independent association was also observed for 
                                        urinary tract, gastrointestinal tract, lung, and hematological cancer incidence (all P < 0.05). Results were similar in the dipstick albuminuria cohort. <br>
                                        <b> Conclusions: </b> Albuminuria was associated with the risk of cancer independent of eGFR. This association was primarily driven by a higher risk of urinary 
                                        tract, gastrointestinal tract, lung, and hematological cancers.

                                    <p> <b> Objectives: </b> To 1) explore trends of risk of bias (ROB) in prediction research over time following key methodological publications, using the Prediction model Risk Of Bias 
                                        ASsessment Tool (PROBAST) and 2) assess the inter-rater agreement of the PROBAST. <br>
                                        <b> Study design and setting: </b> PubMed and Web of Science were searched for reviews with extractable PROBAST scores on domain and signaling question (SQ) level. ROB trends were 
                                        visually correlated with yearly citations of key-publications. Inter-rater agreement was assessed using Cohen’s Kappa. <br>
                                        <b> Results: </b> 139 systematic reviews were included, of which 85 reviews (containing 2477 single studies) on domain level and 54 reviews (containing 2458 single studies) on SQ 
                                        level. High ROB was prevalent, especially in the Analysis domain, and overall trends of ROB remained relatively stable over time. The inter-rater agreement was low, both on domain 
                                        (Kappa 0.04-0.26) and SQ level (Kappa -0.14-0.49). <br>
                                        <b> Conclusion: </b> Prediction model studies are at high ROB and time trends in ROB as assessed with the PROBAST remain relatively stable. These results might be explained by key-
                                        publications having no influence on ROB or recency of key-publications. Moreover, the trend may suffer from the low inter-rater agreement and ceiling effect of the PROBAST. The 
                                        inter-rater agreement could potentially be improved by altering the PROBAST or providing training on how to apply the PROBAST.

                                    <p> <b> Introduction: </b> Women of reproductive age with chronic kidney disease (CKD) are recognised to have decreased fertility and a higher risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes. How 
                                        often CKD afflicts women of reproductive age is not well known. This study aimed to evaluate the burden of CKD and associated birth rates in an entire region. <br>
                                        <b> Methods: </b> This was a retrospective cohort study including women of childbearing age in Stockholm during 2006-2015. We estimated the prevalence of "probable CKD" by the 
                                        presence of an ICD-10 diagnosis of CKD, a single estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) &lt; 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 or history of maintenance dialysis. By linkage with the Swedish 
                                        Medical Birth Register we identified births during the subsequent three years from study inclusion and evaluated birth rates. <br>
                                        <b> Results: </b> We identified 817,730 women in our region, of whom 55% had at least one creatinine measurement. A total of 3938 women were identified as having probable CKD, 
                                        providing an age-averaged CKD prevalence of 0.50%. Women with probable CKD showed a lower birth rate 3 years after the index date (35.7 children per 1000 person years) than the 
                                        remaining women free from CKD (46.5 children per 1000 person years). <br>
                                        <b> Conclusion: </b>  As many as 0.50% of individuals in this cohort had probable CKD, defined on the basis of at least one eGFR&lt;60 ml/min1.73 m2 test result, dialysis treatment 
                                        (i.e. CKD stages 3-5) or an ICD-10 diagnosis of CKD. This prevalence is lower than previous estimates. Women with probable CKD, according to a study mainly capturing CKD 3-5, had a 
                                        lower birth rate than those without CKD, illustrating the challenges of this population to successfully conceive.

                                        of use of evidence-based medical therapies in HF across CKD stages.  <br>
                                        <b> Methods and results: </b> We studied HF patients with reduced (HFrEF) and mildly reduced (HFmrEF) ejection fraction enrolled in the Swedish Heart Failure Registry in 2009-2018. 
                                        We investigated the likelihood of physicians to prescribe guideline-recommended therapies to patients with CKD, and of patients to fill the prescriptions within 90 days of incident 
                                        HF (initiating therapy), to adhere (proportion of days covered ≥80%) and persist (continued use) on these treatments during the first year of therapy. We identified 31 668 patients 
                                        with HFrEF (median age 74 years, 46% CKD). The proportions receiving a prescription for angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers/angiotensin receptor-
                                        neprilysin inhibitors (ACEi/ARB/ARNi) were 96%, 92%, 86%, and 68%, for estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) ≥60, 45-59, 30-44, and &lt;30 ml/min/1.73 m2 , respectively; for

                                        MRA) 38%, 35%, 28%, and 15%. Patients with CKD were less likely to initiate these medications, and less likely to adhere to and persist on ACEi/ARB/ARNi, MRA, and triple therapy. 
                                        Among stoppers, CKD patients were less likely to restart these medications. Results were consistent after multivariable adjustment and in patients with HFmrEF (n = 15 114).  <br>

                                        even at eGFR categories where these therapies are recommended and have shown efficacy in clinical trials.

                                    <p> <b> Background: </b> The risk-benefit ratio of continuing with renin-angiotensin system inhibitors (RASi) after an episode of acute kidney injury (AKI) is unclear. While stopping 
                                        RASi may prevent recurrent AKI or hyperkalaemia, it may deprive patients of the cardiovascular benefits of using RASi. <br>
                                        <b> Methods: </b> We analysed outcomes of long-term RASi users experiencing AKI (stage 2 or 3, or clinically coded) during hospitalization in Stockholm and Sweden during 2007-18. 
                                        We compared stopping RASi within 3 months after discharge with continuing RASi. The primary study outcome was the composite of all-cause mortality, myocardial infarction (MI) and 
                                        stroke. Recurrent AKI was our secondary outcome and we considered hyperkalaemia as a positive control outcome. Propensity score overlap weighted Cox models were used to estimate 
                                        hazard ratios (HRs), balancing 75 confounders. Weighted absolute risk differences (ARDs) were also determined. <br>
                                        <b> Results: </b> We included 10 165 individuals, of whom 4429 stopped and 5736 continued RASi, with a median follow-up of 2.3 years. The median age was 78 years; 45% were women 
                                        and median kidney function before the index episode of AKI was 55 mL/min/1.73 m2. After weighting, those who stopped had an increased risk [HR, 95% confidence interval (CI)] of 
                                        the composite of death, MI and stroke [1.13, 1.07-1.19; ARD 3.7, 95% CI 2.6-4.8] compared with those who continued, a similar risk of recurrent AKI (0.94, 0.84-1.05) and a decreased 
                                        risk of hyperkalaemia (0.79, 0.71-0.88). <br>
                                        <b> Discussion: </b> Stopping RASi use among survivors of moderate-to-severe AKI was associated with a similar risk of recurrent AKI, but higher risk of the composite of death, 
                                        MI and stroke.

                                        outcomes in routine clinical practice, which have never been directly compared in head-to-head outcome trials. <br>
                                        <b> Methods: </b>  We compared outcomes of adults who newly started SGLT2i or GLP1-RA therapy in Stockholm, Sweden, during 2013-2019. The primary outcome was major adverse cardiovascular events 
                                        (MACE), a composite of cardiovascular (CV) death, myocardial infarction and stroke. Secondary outcomes included the individual MACE components and hospitalization for heart failure. Cox regression 
                                        with propensity score overlap weighting was used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals and adjust for 57 covariates.  <br>
                                        <b> Results: </b> We included 12,375 individuals, of which 5489 initiated SGLT2i and 6886 GLP1-RA therapy, followed for median 1.6 years. Mean age was 61 years and 37.6% were women. Compared with 
                                        GLP1-RA, SGLT2i new users had similar risk of MACE risk (adjusted HR 1.04; 95% CI 0.83-1.31). The adjusted HRs (95% CI) for SGLT2i vs. GLP1-RA were 0.80 (0.59-1.09) for heart failure hospitalization, 
                                        0.95 (0.58-1.55) for cardiovascular death, 0.91 (0.67-1.24) for myocardial infarction and 1.71 (1.14-2.59) for ischemic stroke (5-year absolute risk difference for stroke 1.9% [95% CI 0.8-3.0]).  <br>
                                        <b> Discussion: </b> In a largely primary-prevention population of people undergoing routine care, no differences were observed in MACE risk among initiators of SGLT2i and GLP1-RA. However, compared 
                                        with GLP1RA, the use of SGLT2i was associated with an increased risk of ischemic stroke that was small in absolute magnitude.

                                    <p> The correlation coefficient is a statistical measure often used in studies to show an association between variables or to look at the agreement between two methods. In this paper, we 
                                        will discuss not only the basics of the correlation coefficient, such as its assumptions and how it is interpreted, but also important limitations when using the correlation coefficient, 
                                        such as its assumption of a linear association and its sensitivity to the range of observations. We will also discuss why the coefficient is invalid when used to assess agreement of two 
                                        methods aiming to measure a certain value, and discuss better alternatives, such as the intraclass coefficient and Bland-Altman's limits of agreement. The concepts discussed in this 
                                        paper are supported with examples from literature in the field of nephrology.

                                    <p> <b> Background: </b> Acute kidney injury (AKI) can affect hospitalized patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), with estimates ranging between 0.5% and 40%. We performed a 
                                        systematic review and meta-analysis of studies reporting incidence, mortality and risk factors for AKI in hospitalized COVID-19 patients <br>
                                        <b> Methods: </b> We systematically searched 11 electronic databases until 29 May 2020 for studies in English reporting original data on AKI and kidney replacement therapy (KRT) in 
                                        hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Incidences of AKI and KRT and risk ratios for mortality associated with AKI were pooled using generalized linear mixed and random-effects models. 
                                        Potential risk factors for AKI were assessed using meta-regression. Incidences were stratified by geographic location and disease severity.  <br>
                                        <b> Results: </b> A total of 3042 articles were identified, of which 142 studies were included, with 49 048 hospitalized COVID-19 patients including 5152 AKI events. The risk of bias 
                                        of included studies was generally low. The pooled incidence of AKI was 28.6% [95% confidence interval (CI) 19.8-39.5] among hospitalized COVID-19 patients from the USA and Europe (20 
                                        studies) and 5.5% (95% CI 4.1-7.4) among patients from China (62 studies), whereas the pooled incidence of KRT was 7.7% (95% CI 5.1-11.4; 18 studies) and 2.2% (95% CI 1.5-3.3; 52 
                                        studies), respectively. Among patients admitted to the intensive care unit, the incidence of KRT was 20.6% (95% CI 15.7-26.7; 38 studies). Meta-regression analyses showed that age, 
                                        male sex, cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, hypertension and chronic kidney disease were associated with the occurrence of AKI; in itself, AKI was associated with an increased 
                                        risk of mortality, with a pooled risk ratio of 4.6 (95% CI 3.3-6.5).  <br>
                                        <b> Discussion: </b> AKI and KRT are common events in hospitalized COVID-19 patients, with estimates varying across geographic locations. Additional studies are needed to better 
                                        understand the underlying mechanisms and optimal treatment of AKI in these patients.

                            I was dissatisfied with the limited online resources to learn R for individuals using it for epidemiologic data analysis. I felt like most online resources where focused on the broader topic of
                            data science, skipping over many steps I deemed important and discussing much information that was not directly relevant to individuals using R for epidemiologic data analysis. Additionally, 
                            many tips and tricks in R remained undershadowed or unused. Therefore, I started creating my own R tutorial, discussing what I believe to be important for individuals starting with R, going from
                            the basics to more advanced topics, with a specific focus on what you need for epidemiologic data analysis. <br> <br>
