                Hejsan! I'm Roemer (['rumər]) and I am currently working as a PhD candidate at the Department of Clinical Epidemiology
                at the Leiden University Medical Center (LUMC) in Leiden, the Netherlands. I am writing my thesis on prediction modelling
                of patient-reported outcome measures in kidney disease, with a special interest in prediction methodology. Besides working 
                on prediction modelling, I like to work on studies revolving around causal inference and treatment trajectories in renal
                pharmacoepidemiology. Last, but not least, I am part of a research team at the Center for Innovation in Medical Education 
                at the LUMC, where we focus on improving assessment in the medical curriculum. <br> <br> 

                Meta-scientifically, my interest goes out to open science and the climate. As a proponent of open science, I aim for my work to 
                be open and transparent, allowing others to build on my work as much as possible. As a person conscious of the climate, I take
                into account my ecological footprint in everything I do, including work. This entails more than visiting conferences and the mode
                of transportation to get there. It is my aim to be conscious of the tools I use while doing research and their carbon footprint. <br> <br> 
                
                Although I am fond of my academic interests, nothing can make me relax like climbing. Although I mainly do bouldering, I am currently
                expanding into top rope climbing and looking to try many other kinds of climbing in the future. When I am not climbing, you are likely
                to find me reading, making puzzles, playing tabletop or video games, taking pictures, dancing to swing music, learning (about) languages,
                or boring someone by talking just a bit too much about the Lord of the Rings or trains. <br> <br> 

                Feel free to browse around and discover more about me! <br> <br> 

                Hejdå, <br> <br>

                    During the first year of my BSc in Medicine, I came into contact with epidemiology and statistics. This kickstarted 
                    a big interest in these fields which I was able to further develop as a teacher in these topics from my second year
                    onwards. In the third year, I further refined my teaching with a minor Medical Education, in which I also started 
                    doing medical education research. To improve my capabilities in doing research, I started learning R and
                    quickly took a liking to programming. This is in short how my three main academic interests, epidemiology, medical
                    education, and programming, came to be.

                            Research methodology and statistics are something I am truly passionate about. Thinking about study design,
                            analyses, and understanding how we can arrive at the correct answers in complex cases using statistics and
                            advanced methodology are always fun. My main experience is renal epidemiology, where I have worked on
                            <span class = "important"> causal inference </span>, especially regarding <span class = "important">
                            comparative effectiveness</span> of drugs. My PhD thesis focuses on <span class = "important"> prediction
                            modelling</span>, especially in the area of patient reported outcomes, with an additional focus on
                            <span class = "important"> advanced modelling strategies</span>. Lastly, I have done multiple studies on
                            <span class = "important"> treatment trajectories</span>.

                            I have always enjoyed teaching and medical education is a perfect crossroad between medicine and teaching
                            for me. The main topics that I <span class = "important"> teach</span> are epidemiology and statistics to 
                            (bio)medical students in the bachelor and master phases of their education. Besides, I do <span class = "important">
                            research</span> on the <span class = "important">assessment</span> of (bio)medical students. Currently, 
                            the focus is on <span class = "important">very short answer questions (VSAQs)</span>. Lastly, I am in training
                            to receive my <span class = "important">University Teaching Qualification (UTQ)</span>.

                        <p>
                            Although many statistical software packages exist that take away the need to program analyses, these make
                            the individual reliant on what is offered in that package. Learning how to program in languages focused
                            on <span class = "important"> statistical analyses</span>, such as <span class = "important"> R</span> and
                            <span class = "important"> Julia</span>, remove a large part of this dependency. Additionally, I can apply 
                            this skill to other uses, such as building <span class = "important"> web calculators for prediction models</span>
                            and writing reports (e.g., <span class = "important"> Quarto</span>). Because in my opinion statistical programming 
                            should first be correct and readable and only second scaleable, I focus on writing <span class = "important"> transparent</span>, 
                            <span class = "important"> readable </span>, and <span class = "important"> clean</span> code with ample
                            <span class = "important"> annotation</span>.
