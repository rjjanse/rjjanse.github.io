                and I am currently working as a PhD candidate at the Department of Clinical Epidemiology
                at the Leiden University Medical Center (LUMC) in Leiden, the Netherlands. I am writing my thesis on prediction modelling
                of patient-reported outcome measures in kidney disease, with a special interest in prediction methodology. Besides working 
                on prediction modelling, I like to work on studies revolving around causal inference and treatment trajectories in renal
                pharmacoepidemiology. Last, but not least, I am part of a research team at the Center for Innovation in Medical Education 
                at the LUMC, where we focus on improving assessment in the medical curriculum. <br> <br> 

                Meta-scientifically, my interest goes out to open science and the climate. As a proponent of open science, I aim for my work to 
                be open and transparent, allowing others to build on my work as much as possible. As a person conscious of the climate, I take
                into account my ecological footprint in everything I do, including work. This entails more than visiting conferences and the mode
                of transportation to get there. It is my aim to be conscious of the tools I use while doing research and their carbon footprint. <br> <br> 
                
                Although I am fond of my academic interests, nothing can make me relax like climbing. Although I mainly do bouldering, I am currently
                expanding into top rope climbing and looking to try many other kinds of climbing in the future. When I am not climbing, you are likely
                to find me reading, making puzzles, playing tabletop or video games, taking pictures, dancing to swing music, learning (about) languages,
                or boring someone by talking just a bit too much about the Lord of the Rings or trains. <br> <br>

                    During the first year of my BSc in Medicine, I came into contact with epidemiology and statistics. This kickstarted 
                    a big interest in these fields which I was able to further develop as a teacher in these topics from my second year
                    onwards. In the third year, I further refined my teaching with a minor Medical Education, in which I also started 
                    doing medical education research. To improve my capabilities in doing research, I started learning R and
                    quickly took a liking to programming. This is in short how my three main academic interests, epidemiology, medical
                    education, and programming, came to be.

                            Research methodology and statistics are something I am truly passionate about. Thinking about study design,
                            analyses, and understanding how we can arrive at the correct answers in complex cases using statistics and
                            advanced methodology are always fun. My main experience is renal epidemiology, where I have worked on
                            <span class = "important"> causal inference</span>, especially regarding <span class = "important">
                            comparative effectiveness</span> of drugs. My PhD thesis focuses on <span class = "important"> prediction
                            modelling</span>, especially in the area of patient reported outcomes, with an additional focus on
                            <span class = "important"> advanced modelling strategies</span>. Lastly, I have done multiple studies on

                            I have always enjoyed teaching and medical education is a perfect crossroad between medicine and teaching
                            for me. The main topics that I <span class = "important"> teach</span> are epidemiology and statistics to 
                            (bio)medical students in the bachelor and master phases of their education. Besides, I do <span class = "important">
                            research</span> on the <span class = "important">assessment</span> of (bio)medical students. Currently, 
                            the focus is on <span class = "important">very short answer questions (VSAQs)</span>. Lastly, I am in training
                            to receive my <span class = "important">University Teaching Qualification (UTQ)</span>.

                        <p>
                            Although many statistical software packages exist that take away the need to program analyses, these make
                            the individual reliant on what is offered in that package. Learning how to program in languages focused
                            on <span class = "important"> statistical analyses</span>, such as <span class = "important"> R</span> and
                            <span class = "important"> Julia</span>, remove a large part of this dependency. Additionally, I can apply 
                            this skill to other uses, such as building <span class = "important"> web calculators for prediction models</span>
                            and writing reports (e.g., <span class = "important"> Quarto</span>). Because in my opinion statistical programming 
                            should first be correct and readable and only second scaleable, I focus on writing <span class = "important"> transparent</span>, 
                            <span class = "important"> readable </span>, and <span class = "important"> clean</span> code with ample

                                    <p> <b> Background: </b> Prognostic models can strongly support individualized care provision and well-informed shared decision-making. There has been an upsurge 
                                        of prognostic research in the field of nephrology, but the uptake of prognostic models in clinical practice remains limited. Therefore, we map out the research 
                                        field of prognostic models for kidney patients and provide directions how to proceed from here. <br>
                                        <b> Methods: </b> We performed a scoping review of studies developing, validating or updating a prognostic model for patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). 
                                        We searched all published models in PubMed and Embase and report predicted outcomes, methodological quality and validation and/or updating efforts. <br>
                                        <b> Results: </b> We found 602 studies, of which 30.1% concerned CKD populations, 31.6% dialysis populations and 38.4% kidney transplantation populations. The 
                                        most frequently predicted outcomes were mortality (n=129), kidney disease progression (n=75) and kidney graft survival (n=54). Most studies provided discrimination 
                                        measures (80.4%), but much less showed calibration results (43.4%). Of the 415 development studies, 28.0% did not perform any validation and 57.6% only internal 
                                        validation. Moreover, only 111 models (26.7%) were externally validated either in the development study itself or in an independent external validation study. 
                                        Finally, in 45.8% of development studies no usable version of the model was reported. <br>
                                        <b> Discussion: </b> To conclude, many prognostic models have been developed for CKD patients, mainly for outcomes related to kidney disease progression and 
                                        patient/graft survival. To bridge the gap between prediction research and kidney patient care, patient-reported outcomes, methodological rigor, complete 
                                        reporting of prognostic models, external validation, updating and impact assessment urgently need more attention.

                                    <p> <b> Background: </b> Multiple choice questions (MCQs) offer high reliability and easy machine-marking, but allow for cueing and stimulate recognition-based 
                                        learning. Very short answer questions (VSAQs), which are open-ended questions requiring a very short answer, may circumvent these limitations. Although VSAQ 
                                        use in medical assessment increases, almost all research on reliability and validity of VSAQs in medical education has been performed by a single research 
                                        group with extensive experience in the development of VSAQs. Therefore, we aimed to validate previous findings about VSAQ reliability, discrimination, and 
                                        acceptability in undergraduate medical students and teachers with limited experience in VSAQs development.  <br>
                                        <b> Methods: </b> To validate the results presented in previous studies, we partially replicated a previous study and extended results on student experiences. 
                                        Dutch undergraduate medical students (n = 375) were randomized to VSAQs first and MCQs second or vice versa in a formative exam in two courses, to determine 
                                        reliability, discrimination, and cueing. Acceptability for teachers (i.e., VSAQ review time) was determined in the summative exam.  <br>
                                        <b> Results: </b> Reliability (Cronbach's &#945;) was 0.74 for VSAQs and 0.57 for MCQs in one course. In the other course, Cronbach's &#945; was 0.87 for VSAQs and 0.83 
                                        for MCQs. Discrimination (average Rir) was 0.27 vs. 0.17 and 0.43 vs. 0.39 for VSAQs vs. MCQs, respectively. Reviewing time of one VSAQ for the entire student 
                                        cohort was ±2 minutes on average. Positive cueing occurred more in MCQs than in VSAQs (20% vs. 4% and 20.8% vs. 8.3% of questions per person in both courses).  <br>
                                        <b> Conclusions: </b> This study validates the positive results regarding VSAQs reliability, discrimination, and acceptability in undergraduate medical students. 
                                        Furthermore, we demonstrate that VSAQ use is reliable among teachers with limited experience in writing and marking VSAQs. The short learning curve for teachers, 
                                        favourable marking time and applicability regardless of the topic suggest that VSAQs might also be valuable beyond medical assessment.

                                    <p> <b> Background: </b> Studies investigating the association of chronic kidney disease and cancer have focused on estimated glomerular filtration (eGFR) 
                                        rather than on albuminuria. This study aimed to examine whether albuminuria is associated with cancer incidence, and whether this association is 
                                        independent of eGFR. <br>
                                        <b> Methods: </b> We included subjects of the Stockholm Creatinine Measurements (SCREAM) project without a history of cancer, 250 768 subjects with at 
                                        least 1 urine albumin-creatinine ratio (ACR) test (primary cohort), and 433 850 subjects with at least 1 dipstick albuminuria test (secondary cohort). 
                                        Albuminuria was quantified as KDIGO albuminuria stages. The primary outcome was overall cancer incidence. Secondary outcomes were site-specific cancer 
                                        incidence rates. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression models adjusted for confounders including eGFR to calculate hazard ratios (HRs, 95% CIs). <br>
                                        <b> Results: </b> During a median follow-up of 4.3 (IQR, 2.0–8.2) years, 21 901 subjects of the ACR cohort developed de novo cancer. In multivariable analyses, 
                                        adjusting among others for eGFR, subjects with an ACR of 30-299 mg/g or ≥300 mg/g had a 23% (HR, 1.23; 95% CI, 1.19–1.28) and 40% (HR, 1.40; 95% CI, 1.31–1.50) 
                                        higher risk of developing cancer, respectively, when compared to subjects with an ACR &#60;30 mg/g. This graded, independent association was also observed for 
                                        urinary tract, gastrointestinal tract, lung, and hematological cancer incidence (all P < 0.05). Results were similar in the dipstick albuminuria cohort. <br>
                                        <b> Conclusions: </b> Albuminuria was associated with the risk of cancer independent of eGFR. This association was primarily driven by a higher risk of urinary 
                                        tract, gastrointestinal tract, lung, and hematological cancers.

                                        ASsessment Tool (PROBAST) and 2) assess the inter-rater agreement of the PROBAST. <br>
                                        <b> Study design and setting: </b> PubMed and Web of Science were searched for reviews with extractable PROBAST scores on domain and signaling question (SQ) level. ROB trends were 
                                        visually correlated with yearly citations of key-publications. Inter-rater agreement was assessed using Cohen’s Kappa. <br>
                                        <b> Results: </b> 139 systematic reviews were included, of which 85 reviews (containing 2477 single studies) on domain level and 54 reviews (containing 2458 single studies) on SQ 
                                        level. High ROB was prevalent, especially in the Analysis domain, and overall trends of ROB remained relatively stable over time. The inter-rater agreement was low, both on domain 
                                        (Kappa 0.04-0.26) and SQ level (Kappa -0.14-0.49). <br>
                                        <b> Conclusion: </b> Prediction model studies are at high ROB and time trends in ROB as assessed with the PROBAST remain relatively stable. These results might be explained by key-
                                        publications having no influence on ROB or recency of key-publications. Moreover, the trend may suffer from the low inter-rater agreement and ceiling effect of the PROBAST. The 
                                        inter-rater agreement could potentially be improved by altering the PROBAST or providing training on how to apply the PROBAST.

                                        often CKD afflicts women of reproductive age is not well known. This study aimed to evaluate the burden of CKD and associated birth rates in an entire region. <br>
                                        <b> Methods: </b> This was a retrospective cohort study including women of childbearing age in Stockholm during 2006-2015. We estimated the prevalence of "probable CKD" by the 
                                        presence of an ICD-10 diagnosis of CKD, a single estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) &lt; 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 or history of maintenance dialysis. By linkage with the Swedish 
                                        Medical Birth Register we identified births during the subsequent three years from study inclusion and evaluated birth rates. <br>
                                        <b> Results: </b> We identified 817,730 women in our region, of whom 55% had at least one creatinine measurement. A total of 3938 women were identified as having probable CKD, 
                                        providing an age-averaged CKD prevalence of 0.50%. Women with probable CKD showed a lower birth rate 3 years after the index date (35.7 children per 1000 person years) than the 
                                        remaining women free from CKD (46.5 children per 1000 person years). <br>
                                        <b> Conclusion: </b>  As many as 0.50% of individuals in this cohort had probable CKD, defined on the basis of at least one eGFR&lt;60 ml/min1.73 m2 test result, dialysis treatment 
                                        (i.e. CKD stages 3-5) or an ICD-10 diagnosis of CKD. This prevalence is lower than previous estimates. Women with probable CKD, according to a study mainly capturing CKD 3-5, had a 
                                        lower birth rate than those without CKD, illustrating the challenges of this population to successfully conceive.

                                        of use of evidence-based medical therapies in HF across CKD stages.  <br>
                                        <b> Methods and results: </b> We studied HF patients with reduced (HFrEF) and mildly reduced (HFmrEF) ejection fraction enrolled in the Swedish Heart Failure Registry in 2009-2018. 
                                        We investigated the likelihood of physicians to prescribe guideline-recommended therapies to patients with CKD, and of patients to fill the prescriptions within 90 days of incident 
                                        HF (initiating therapy), to adhere (proportion of days covered ≥80%) and persist (continued use) on these treatments during the first year of therapy. We identified 31 668 patients 
                                        with HFrEF (median age 74 years, 46% CKD). The proportions receiving a prescription for angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers/angiotensin receptor-
                                        neprilysin inhibitors (ACEi/ARB/ARNi) were 96%, 92%, 86%, and 68%, for estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) ≥60, 45-59, 30-44, and &lt;30 ml/min/1.73 m2 , respectively; for

                                        MRA) 38%, 35%, 28%, and 15%. Patients with CKD were less likely to initiate these medications, and less likely to adhere to and persist on ACEi/ARB/ARNi, MRA, and triple therapy. 
                                        Among stoppers, CKD patients were less likely to restart these medications. Results were consistent after multivariable adjustment and in patients with HFmrEF (n = 15 114).  <br>
                                        <b> Conclusions: </b> Patients with HF and CKD are less likely to be prescribed and to fill prescriptions for evidence-based therapies, showing lower adherence and persistence,

                                        RASi may prevent recurrent AKI or hyperkalaemia, it may deprive patients of the cardiovascular benefits of using RASi. <br>
                                        <b> Methods: </b> We analysed outcomes of long-term RASi users experiencing AKI (stage 2 or 3, or clinically coded) during hospitalization in Stockholm and Sweden during 2007-18. 
                                        We compared stopping RASi within 3 months after discharge with continuing RASi. The primary study outcome was the composite of all-cause mortality, myocardial infarction (MI) and 
                                        stroke. Recurrent AKI was our secondary outcome and we considered hyperkalaemia as a positive control outcome. Propensity score overlap weighted Cox models were used to estimate 
                                        hazard ratios (HRs), balancing 75 confounders. Weighted absolute risk differences (ARDs) were also determined. <br>
                                        <b> Results: </b> We included 10 165 individuals, of whom 4429 stopped and 5736 continued RASi, with a median follow-up of 2.3 years. The median age was 78 years; 45% were women 
                                        and median kidney function before the index episode of AKI was 55 mL/min/1.73 m2. After weighting, those who stopped had an increased risk [HR, 95% confidence interval (CI)] of 
                                        the composite of death, MI and stroke [1.13, 1.07-1.19; ARD 3.7, 95% CI 2.6-4.8] compared with those who continued, a similar risk of recurrent AKI (0.94, 0.84-1.05) and a decreased 
                                        risk of hyperkalaemia (0.79, 0.71-0.88). <br>
                                        <b> Discussion: </b> Stopping RASi use among survivors of moderate-to-severe AKI was associated with a similar risk of recurrent AKI, but higher risk of the composite of death, 
                                        MI and stroke.

                                        <b> Methods: </b>  We compared outcomes of adults who newly started SGLT2i or GLP1-RA therapy in Stockholm, Sweden, during 2013-2019. The primary outcome was major adverse cardiovascular events 
                                        (MACE), a composite of cardiovascular (CV) death, myocardial infarction and stroke. Secondary outcomes included the individual MACE components and hospitalization for heart failure. Cox regression

                                    <p> The correlation coefficient is a statistical measure often used in studies to show an association between variables or to look at the agreement between two methods. In this paper, we 
                                        will discuss not only the basics of the correlation coefficient, such as its assumptions and how it is interpreted, but also important limitations when using the correlation coefficient, 
                                        such as its assumption of a linear association and its sensitivity to the range of observations. We will also discuss why the coefficient is invalid when used to assess agreement of two 
                                        methods aiming to measure a certain value, and discuss better alternatives, such as the intraclass coefficient and Bland-Altman's limits of agreement. The concepts discussed in this 
                                        paper are supported with examples from literature in the field of nephrology.

                                    <p> <b> Background: </b> Acute kidney injury (AKI) can affect hospitalized patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), with estimates ranging between 0.5% and 40%. We performed a 
                                        systematic review and meta-analysis of studies reporting incidence, mortality and risk factors for AKI in hospitalized COVID-19 patients <br>
                                        <b> Methods: </b> We systematically searched 11 electronic databases until 29 May 2020 for studies in English reporting original data on AKI and kidney replacement therapy (KRT) in 
                                        hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Incidences of AKI and KRT and risk ratios for mortality associated with AKI were pooled using generalized linear mixed and random-effects models. 
                                        Potential risk factors for AKI were assessed using meta-regression. Incidences were stratified by geographic location and disease severity.  <br>
                                        <b> Results: </b> A total of 3042 articles were identified, of which 142 studies were included, with 49 048 hospitalized COVID-19 patients including 5152 AKI events. The risk of bias 
                                        of included studies was generally low. The pooled incidence of AKI was 28.6% [95% confidence interval (CI) 19.8-39.5] among hospitalized COVID-19 patients from the USA and Europe (20 
                                        studies) and 5.5% (95% CI 4.1-7.4) among patients from China (62 studies), whereas the pooled incidence of KRT was 7.7% (95% CI 5.1-11.4; 18 studies) and 2.2% (95% CI 1.5-3.3; 52 
                                        studies), respectively. Among patients admitted to the intensive care unit, the incidence of KRT was 20.6% (95% CI 15.7-26.7; 38 studies). Meta-regression analyses showed that age, 
                                        male sex, cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, hypertension and chronic kidney disease were associated with the occurrence of AKI; in itself, AKI was associated with an increased 
                                        risk of mortality, with a pooled risk ratio of 4.6 (95% CI 3.3-6.5).  <br>
                                        <b> Discussion: </b> AKI and KRT are common events in hospitalized COVID-19 patients, with estimates varying across geographic locations. Additional studies are needed to better 
                                        understand the underlying mechanisms and optimal treatment of AKI in these patients.
