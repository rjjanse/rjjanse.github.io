                Hejsan! I'm Roemer (['rumər]) and I am currently working as a PhD candidate at the Department of Clinical Epidemiology
                at the Leiden University Medical Center (LUMC) in Leiden, the Netherlands. I am writing my thesis on prediction modelling
                of patient-reported outcome measures in kidney disease, with a special interest in prediction methodology. Besides working 
                on prediction modelling, I like to work on studies revolving around causal inference and treatment trajectories in renal
                pharmacoepidemiology. Last, but not least, I am part of a research team at the Center for Innovation in Medical Education 
                at the LUMC, where we focus on improving assessment in the medical curriculum. <br> <br> 

                Meta-scientifically, my interest goes out to open science and the climate. As a proponent of open science, I aim for my work to 
                be open and transparent, allowing others to build on my work as much as possible. As a person conscious of the climate, I take
                into account my ecological footprint in everything I do, including work. This entails more than visiting conferences and the mode
                of transportation to get there. It is my aim to be conscious of the tools I use while doing research and their carbon footprint. <br> <br> 
                
                Although I am fond of my academic interests, nothing can make me relax like climbing. Although I mainly do bouldering, I am currently
                expanding into top rope climbing and looking to try many other kinds of climbing in the future. When I am not climbing, you are likely
                to find me reading, making puzzles, playing tabletop or video games, taking pictures, dancing to swing music, learning (about) language,
                or boring someone by talking just a bit too much about the Lord of the Rings or trains. <br> <br> 

                Feel free to browse around and discover more about me! <br> <br> 

                Hejdå, <br> <br> 

                Roemer
